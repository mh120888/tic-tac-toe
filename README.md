# tic-tac-toe
A command line tic tac toe game in Ruby

To play, clone the repo, then run `ruby ttt.rb`.

The game is currently hard-coded for the human player to go first and to play with 'x'. It can easily be extended to make these options configurable in the future.

**Update: Added the option to choose whether you go first or second and to choose if you'd like to play with 'x' or 'o'.**
